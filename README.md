# Tasty Tales

Tasty Tales is a full stack web application that gives user a platform to view and share their recipes. The intention of the website is to provide a simple, intuitive, visually appealing and user-friendly platform where users can find recipes shared by food-loving people from around the globe, share their recipes and interact with the community. The intended target audience is anyone with an interest in cooking and exploring world cuisines. The target audience will be mostly span across men and women from young adults to older generations.

- The interactive application implements user authorisation and full CRUD functionality allowing users to create, update, read and delete recipes stored in a relational database management system. Users can also search recipes, like recipes and interact with other users via comments.
- The Tasty Tales website also features a back-end admin dashborad that allows an administrator to review and approve user comments, as well as monitor and edit recipes.

- The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and the Django framework as a Portfolio Project#4 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Course.
